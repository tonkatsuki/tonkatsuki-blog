# Intro

A couple years back I decided to move off Windows for my daily driving. I was mainly tired of the poor performance and battery life of modern x86_64 laptops, and Microsoft's continued push to bloat up the OS with junk on even the most basic installs. For quite a few years I spent doing a lot of SCCM/MECM endpoint management for Windows desktop/servers, so this was a big change for me. After 2 years I can definitely say it's been a great change for me. Before settling on macOS, I did run Arch briefly, but due to minor annoyances with software package support, minor issues with laptops, mainly around high DPI displays and iGPU + dGPU handling, I settled on macOS. These days I still have a beefy x86_64 Windows machine for running VMware Workstation to virtualize EVE-NG and Containerlab, but I spend the vast majority of my day in macOS.

A lot of the tools below have very good, if not better, Linux support as well. So if you're running Linux that means you might want to check them out too! And of course, WSL may be an option for many of these tools too.
